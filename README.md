## Overview

MentorMe is a dynamic, community-powered web platform designed to connect learners (mentees) with experienced individuals (mentors) for peer-led mentoring sessions. The core mission is to democratize access to informal guidance, empower personal growth, and foster meaningful one-on-one learning experiences \-especially for communities in tech, education, and career development.

## Problem Statement

Traditional mentorship platforms often rely on rigid structures, exclusive access, or corporate affiliations. MentorMe creates barriers to entry for those without elite networks or institutional backing.  
MentorMe tackles this by offering:

- A decentralized approach to mentorship.  
- An interest-based discovery and recommendation engine.  
- A scheduling system that balances availability across time zones and commitments.  
- Peer accountability without bureaucracy.

## Category

**MentorMe** is a **student-focused mentorship networking platform** that enables peer connections between mentees and mentors within the student community. It belongs to the broader category of **education-focused social platforms**, with a distinct twist- it‚Äôs not about showcasing accomplishments, but about creating **intentional, goal-driven mentorship connections.**  
Unlike generic networking tools, MentorMe streamlines the mentorship journey: from finding a mentor, to requesting support, to staying connected. Think *Linkedin, but built entirely around students helping students grow* \- one connection at a time.

## Story

MentorMe was created to solve a deeply personal and widespread problem: **students often don‚Äôt know where to go for guidance**. Whether it‚Äôs choosing a career path, applying to internships, learning a new skill, or just figuring out what‚Äôs next \- the journey is often overwhelming, especially for students without built-in support systems.

What makes MentorMe different is its **peer-driven structure**. Unlike traditional mentorship models that rely on professional outreach or cold networking, MentorMe empowers **students to mentor other students** \- forming a loop of guidance, learning, and growth.

In this system:

- **Only mentees can initiate a connection \-** keeping the platform low-pressure for mentors and intentional for mentees.  
- **Mentors can accept or decline** \- maintaining autonomy and trust.  
- Once accepted, **a connection is formed** and tracked in a dedicated space \- enabling follow-up session scheduling, and relational building.

The idea was born from seeing how much potential and knowledge exists within student communities \- but how little of it gets shared. MentorMe gives that potential a structure, a platform, and a purpose.

## Market

MentorMe is designed for university/college students (primary group).  
College students often:
- Feel uncertain about career decisions  
- Struggle to find relatable guidance  
- Desire  mentorship, but don‚Äôt know how or where to start. 

### Why MentorMe for College Students?

- Most platforms like Linkedin are too formal or intimidating  
- Cold outreach rarely results in real connection  
- They prefer talking to someone ‚Äújust a few steps ahead‚Äù who understands their journey.

MentorMe provides a **familiar, social environment** tailored for students \- removing friction from finding mentorship, and making it part of their learning process.

In the future, the platform could expand to include:

- Alumni networks  
- Professional mentors  
- Organization-based mentoring (e.g. student orgs or clubs)

## Habit 

MentorMe is designed to create **meaningful, recurring engagement** without overwhelming users. The core interaction loop is simple and intentional.

### For Mentees:

1. **Browse a feed of available mentors** via search of the top number of recommendations.  
2. **Send a connection request** to someone aligned with their goals or interests.  
3. If accepted, the connection appears on their **Connections page.**   
4. From there further actions such as creating sessions, creating tasks, and building a relationship overtime can be executed.

### For Mentors:

1. **Receive requests** from mentees.  
2. **Accept or decline** based on availability or interest.  
3. Stay in control of how and when they engage, reducing pressure.

## üß≠ Scope

The current version of **MentorMe** delivers the **core building blocks** for student-to-student mentorship.

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs built now:
- **Role-based onboarding**: users join as a mentee or mentor  
- **Interest and background setup**: profiles reflect what users are looking for or can offer  
- **Connection system**:  
  - *Only mentees can send requests*  
  - *Mentors can accept or decline*  
  - *Accepted connections are stored and displayed*  
- **Connections page**: users can view all their active mentorship links  
- **Smart recommendations**: mentors suggested based on profile data and interests  
- **Search and filtering**: users can search for mentors by skills, interests, and more  
- **Session scheduling suggestion**: conflict-aware logic that checks availability  
- **Dark/light mode**: responsive UI design

## Technical Challenges

### Technical Challenge \#1 \- üß† Recommendation System 
[Recommendation System Documentatation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I1KhixNyWTjoKgGhMlTU-pD2xTB7GG7eQAR7PeGfNV8/edit?tab=t.0)

## üåü Overview

A recommendation system that recommends mentors to mentees based on common interest or goals. The system is designed to help mentees discover mentors who are most aligned with their goals, interests, and potential fit - without overwhelming them with irrelevant options.

The goal is to recommend mentors who are:

* Aligned with the mentee‚Äôs academic background and interests  
* Semantically relevant based on bio similarity  
* Behaviorally connected via shared interaction patterns  
* Not already connected or blocked  
* Available and actively participating  

---

#### How
![flowchart](doc/flowcharts//Recommendation%20System%20Flowchart.jpg)



This document outlines the design and logic of the MentorMe recommendation engine. It uses a **hybrid approach** combining content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and semantic vector similarity to generate relevant mentor suggestions for each user.

---

## üß© System Components

### 1. **Content-Based Filtering**

Each mentor is scored based on how well their profile fields match the mentee's profile.

**Scoring Weights:**

| Profile Field | Weight | Reasoning |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Bio           | 4.0    | Rich in natural language ‚Äî captures tone, skills, and experience |
| Interest      | 3.0    | Primary signal of topical alignment |
| Major         | 1.5    | Academic compatibility |
| School        | 1.0    | Cultural and institutional alignment |
| Bonus Match   | 1.5    | Extra score for strong or multiple overlaps |

* Matching is done via token overlap and typo-tolerant fuzzy search (Fuse.js).

---

### 2. **Collaborative Filtering via Graph Traversal**

* Constructs an interaction graph of mentee to mentor connections 
* Performs BFS from the logged in mentee to find nearby users (mentors)  
* Scores each mentor on the network based on:
  * **Proximity** (1 / hop distance)
  * **Number of connections** with other mentees

* This allows indirect but behaviorally relevant mentor recommendations.

---

### 3. **Semantic Vector Similarity**

* Converts user and mentor bios into tokenized term vectors  
* Computes **cosine similarity** between:
  * Mentee vector (interests + bio)
  * Mentor vector (interests + bio)  
* Outputs a `vectorScore` reflecting semantic closeness

* Captures meaning even when keywords differ.


## ‚öñÔ∏è Final Score Calculation

The total recommendation score is computed as:

totalScore = contentScore  + graphScore + vectorScore

* Each component is normalized  
* Individual components can be weighted (e.g. `vectorScore √ó 1.2`)  
* Top mentors are returned based on the sorted final score


## üõë Exclusion Criteria

Mentors are excluded from results if:

* They are already connected to the user  
* They are blocked by the user  
* They have no overlapping availability with the user  

---

## üîÅ Flow Summary

1. **Input**: Mentee profile and history  
2. **Filter**: Remove blocked or already connected mentors  
3. **Score**: Apply content-based, graph-based, and vector-based scoring  
4. **Sort**: Rank mentors by total score  
5. **Output**: Return top N mentor suggestions


## ‚úÖ Frontend Integration

* Uses `/recommendations` endpoint  
* Results rendered in mentor cards with ‚ÄúExpress Interest‚Äù CTA  
* Updates dynamically on:
  * Interest changes  
  * New mentor joins  
  * Session or connection updates

---

## üí° Future Improvements

* Use embeddings (e.g. BERT) for smarter semantic matching  
* Prioritize mentors with open time slots  


### Technical Challenge \#2
[Scheduling System Documenation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fXDvHjGgdr1wBWDQqU5W394Eh8L3YS1JpI_BicTFzQg/edit?tab=t.0)
#### What

**Overview:**

The MentorMe Scheduling System is designed to efficiently connect mentees with new mentors by identifying optimal meeting times. It prioritizes finding available time slots and intelligently resolving any conflicts that arise.

The Scheduling system is a core component of MentorMe that ensures mentees and mentors can meet efficiently without calendar conflicts.

Its primary function is to:

* Match mutual availability between mentees and mentors.  
* Detect and prevent scheduling overlaps.  
* Intelligently resolve conflicts by suggesting an option to reschedule an existing session to free up time slots between connections.

This system is crucial for:

* Providing a smooth and reliable user experience.  
* Maximizing mentor-mentee engagement by making the most of limited availability.  
* Enabling smart session coordination without manual back-and-forth.

# üìÖ Scheduling System ‚Äî MentorMe

This document provides a complete overview of MentorMe‚Äôs scheduling system, describing the logic behind session suggestions, conflict resolution, and freed-slot reuse when cancellations occur.

---

## üß† Part 1: Best Time to Meet

This section describes the process for identifying suitable meeting times:

1. **Gather & Order Intervals:** Collect all available time intervals for both the mentee and the new mentor, and sort them chronologically.
2. **Apply User Preference:** Identify time intervals where neither party has an existing session, ensuring these free slots align with the user‚Äôs availability. If a day is fully booked, the system moves to the next.
3. **Present Suggestions:** Propose the most suitable mutual meeting times between both users.

---

## üîÑ Part 2: Time Conflict Resolution (Fallback)

This section outlines how the system handles scenarios where mutual availability is blocked by an existing session:

1. **Identify Blocking Sessions:** The system scans existing mentee sessions that overlap with mutual availability between a mentee and a new mentor.
2. **Find Rescheduling Options:** For each blocking session, it checks if it can be moved to a new mutual time between the mentee and the *existing* mentor of that session.
3. **Return First Successful Option:** If a viable reschedule is found, the system proposes this plan and uses the freed slot for the new session.

---

## ‚ùå Part 3: Cancellability-Based Reschedule Suggestions

When a user cancels a session, the system immediately reuses the now-freed time to **suggest new meetings** with the user‚Äôs other connections ‚Äî including the one they just canceled with.

### Key Behavior:
- Only sessions marked `cancelable: true` trigger this logic.
- Suggestions are **only made to the user who canceled**, scoped to their existing mentor or mentee connections.
- The system checks for overlapping availability and schedule conflicts before offering new suggestions.


## üß© Pseudocode Summary

### Best Time to Meet

1. **Data Modeling:**  
   Add `Availability` and `Session` models. Define weekdays using Prisma enums.

2. **Get Mentee Sessions:**  
   Fetch all mentee sessions and group by day.

3. **Get Mentor Sessions:**  
   For each connected mentor, retrieve sessions and availability.

4. **Find Free Slots:**  
   Subtract session intervals from availability for both mentee and mentor.

5. **Compare Free Times:**  
   Find overlapping free intervals between users.

6. **Return Suggestions:**  
   Store and display sorted suggestions based on availability and alignment.

---

### Time Conflict Resolution

1. **Find Mentor‚Äôs Free Time:**  
   Subtract the mentor‚Äôs existing sessions from their availability.

2. **Map Blocking Sessions:**  
   Loop through mentee sessions and record mentor-session pairs.

3. **Try Rescheduling Each Blocker:**  
   For each session:
   - Check if the existing mentor has another mutual free time with the mentee.
   - If yes, suggest rescheduling and free up the blocked time.

---

## üõ† Database Integration

MentorMe uses **PostgreSQL**, managed through **Prisma ORM**, to persist all scheduling-related data.

### Key Models:
- `User`: Stores user profile and role (`MENTOR` or `MENTEE`)
- `Mentorship`: Tracks connections between users
- `Request`: Manages connection requests
- `Availability`: Stores recurring weekly time slots for each user
- `Session`: Stores scheduled session data with timing, participants, and cancelability

---

## ‚úÖ Frontend Integration

- **Cancel Flow:**
  - When a user cancels a session, a DELETE request is made to `/session/:id`
  - If the session was cancelable, the backend returns suggested replacement sessions
  - These are shown as suggestions immediately in the UI (e.g., ‚ÄúYou now have an open slot with Alice from 3‚Äì4 PM‚Äù)

- **Suggestions UI:**
  - Suggestions are displayed as banners or toast-like components
  - Users can optionally click to schedule that session manually


## üí° Future Improvements

- Support for dynamic session durations (e.g., 30 or 45 minutes)
- Auto-detection of double-bookings
- Session priority scoring during fallback resolution
- Calendar view of all free slots and suggestions

---

# **External APIs**
MentorMe integrates the **College Scorecard API** (U.S. Department of Education) during onboarding. This API standardizes college name inputs by matching user-provided values to verified institutional records, improving data quality across user profiles.

# **Authentication**
User authentication is handled using **Express sessions** for persistent login across visits.  
* On login/signup, credentials are verified using **bcrypt**, and a session is stored via `express-session`.  
* Middleware protects backend routes by validating session data before granting access.  
* On the frontend, a global `UserContext` tracks session state and role, enabling conditional rendering and navigation.  
* Pages are wrapped in a **role-based protection layer**, ensuring that only users with the appropriate role (e.g., mentor-only pages) can access certain routes.  
* This structure allows seamless page navigation without requiring repeated logins or manual role checks.


# **Visuals and Interactions**

## *Interesting Cursor Interaction*  
A **custom tooltip** appears when hovering over a mentor's profile image. This tooltip displays additional metadata (e.g., school or location), implemented using conditional rendering and Framer Motion for smooth entry/exit transitions.

## *UI Component with Custom Visual Styling*  
The **Connections page** features a **tabbed navigation system**, where tabs respond to hover and active states. This is built using **Tailwind CSS** with custom variants for a polished, interactive feel tailored to MentorMe‚Äôs visual identity.

## *Loading State*  
Async operations throughout the app‚Äîsuch as login, fetching mentors, or scheduling sessions‚Äîtrigger **loading indicators** (spinners or skeleton UIs). These are implemented using conditional state flags and ensure a smooth, responsive user experience during backend calls.

## üöÄ Stretch Features

### *Task Management System*
MentorMe includes a built-in task management feature that empowers users‚Äîparticularly mentees‚Äîto organize their mentorship goals.

* Users can:
  * Create new tasks with a **title**, **description**, and **priority level** (e.g., high, medium, low)
  * Track task progress by updating their status to one of three categories:
    * **To Do** ‚Äì Initial state, indicating tasks that need attention  
    * **In Progress** ‚Äì Tasks actively being worked on  
    * **Complete** ‚Äì Finished tasks that serve as a log of accomplishments

This feature is tightly integrated into the mentorship workflow, promoting structure, accountability, and productivity.

---

### *Fuzzy Search for Mentor Discovery*
To enhance discoverability and personalization, MentorMe implements a dynamic fuzzy search system powered by **Fuse.js**.

* Mentees can:
  * Search using **partial matches** or **typo-tolerant** input
  * Look across multiple fields including **name**, **interest**, **school**, and **major**
  * View real-time filtered results as they type

This makes it easier for mentees to find and connect with relevant mentors quickly and intuitively.

---

### *Light/Dark Mode Support*
MentorMe‚Äôs UI supports **automatic light/dark mode** based on the user‚Äôs system preference.

* Implemented using:
  * CSS media queries
  * Tailwind‚Äôs `dark` variant styling

* Benefits:
  * Dynamically adapts without manual toggle
  * Enhances accessibility and visual comfort
  * Maintains a clean, modern experience aligned with device settings


### Final Review
Thanks to the codepath sessions and feedbacks from my manager, Andrew and peer mentor, Madhu and Chandra, this project was completed.
